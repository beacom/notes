# Algorithms
An algorithm is a well defined computational procedure.
## Analysis
### Running Time
The running time of an algorithm is the number of primitive operations required to execute the algorithm.
- O(n) : the asymptotic uppper bound and performance, worst case scenario
- Θ(n) : asymptotic upper & lower bound
- Ω(n) : asymptotic lower bound, best case scenario
## Design
### Incremental Approach
Performing computations on a small portion of the input at a time and gradually arriving and the desired output.
### Divide & Conquer Approach
1. Divide the problem into subproblems. 
2. Conquer the subproblems when the input is small enough solve it.
3. Combine the outputs of the conquer steps to yield the final output.
