# Algorithms
An alorithm is a well defined computational procedure.
## Analysis
### Running Time
The running time of an algorithm is the number of primitive operations required to execute the algorithm.
## Design
### Incremental Approach
Performing computation on a small portion of the input at a time and gradually arriving and the desired output.
### Dive & Conquer Approach
1. Divide the problem into subproblems. 
2. Conquer the subproblems when the input is small enough solve it.
3. Combine the outputs of the conquer steps to yield the final output.
