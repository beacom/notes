## Algebra

This section draws heavily from _Prelude to Calculus_ by Warren L. Rudd and Terry L. Shell.

### Integers
The integers are all non-fractional values.

$`\dots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \cdots `$

### Natural Numbers
The natural numbers are all positive integers. Zero is often included in the set of natural numbers, notably by Cormen, Leiserson, & Rivest in Introduction to Algorithms. Doing so makes the definition equivalent to that of the whole numbers below.

$` 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \cdots `$

### Whole Numbers
The whole numbers are all non-negative integers.

$` 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \cdots `$

### Rational Numbers
The rational numbers are all numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of integers. An infinite number of rational numbers exist between any two rational numbers.

$` \frac{1}{4} , \frac{12}{5} , -\frac{3}{5}  `$

The decimal representation of a rational number either terminates or eventually repreats.

### Irrational Numbers
The irrational numbers are values that on the number line from negative $`\infty`$ to positive $`\infty`$, but cannot be represented as a ratio of integers.

$` \sqrt{2} `$, any $`\sqrt[3]{n}`$ where n is not the cubed root of a rational number, $` \pi `$, $`e`$

The decimal representation of an irrational number neither terminate nor repeat.

### Real Numbers
Real numbers are all rational and irrational numbers.

#### Absolute Value

The absolute value of a real number is the magnitude of the number from the origin.

$$ |a| =  
    \begin{cases}
      a & \quad \text{if a} \geq 0 \\
      -a & \quad \text{if a} < 0
    \end{cases}
$$

#### Distance

The distance between two real numbers a and b is: $` |a - b| = |b - a| `$

### Exponents
If _b_ is a real number and _n_ is an integer with a value where _n_ > 0, then $` b^{n}`$ = $` b \times b \times b \times b \times b \dotsb b \times b`$ with _n_ instances of _b_.

#### Properties of Exponents

If a and b are real numbers and n and m are integers, then:

$$
a^{m}a^{n} = a^{m+n}
$$

$$
\frac{a^{m}}{a^{n}} = a^{m - n}
$$

$$
(ab)^{n} = a^{n}b^{n}
$$

$$
\binom{a}{b}^{n} = \frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}} \quad \text{where} \quad b \neq 0
$$

$$
(a^{m})^{n} = a^{mn}
$$
