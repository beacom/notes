## Algebra

This section draws heavily from _Prelude to Calculus_ by Warren L. Rudd and Terry L. Shell.

### Integers
Integers are all non-fractional values.

...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...

### Natural Numbers
Natural numbers are all positive integers.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

### Whole Numbers
Whole numbers are all non-negative integers.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4...

### Rational Numbers
Rational numbers are all numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of integers. An infinite number of rational numbers exist between any two rational numbers.

$` \frac{1}{4} , \frac{12}{5} , -\frac{3}{5}  `$

### Irrational Numbers
Irrational numbers are values that on the number line from negative $`\infty`$ to positive $`\infty`$, but cannot be represented as a ratio of integers.

$` \sqrt{2} `$, any $`\sqrt[3]{n}`$ where n is not the cubed root of a rational number, $` \pi `$, $`e`$

### Real Numbers
Real numbers are all rational and irrational numbers.
