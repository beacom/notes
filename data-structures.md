# Data Structures

## Sets

A set is an unordered collection of distinguishable elements.

### Equality

Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements.

### Empty Set

An empty set contains no elements and is denoted by the symbol âˆ….

### Subset

If all the elements of a set A are contained in set B, then A is a subset of B. This relationship is denoted by: $` A \subseteq B `$

### Proper Subset

Set A is a proper subset of B if A and B are not equal. A proper subset relationship is denoted as: $` A \subset B `$

### Cardinality

The cardinality of a set is the number of elements within a set, for a set S this is denoted by: $` |S| `$

#### Finite Set

A set is finite if its cardinality is a natural number. (Some may quibble regarding whether zero is a natural number.)

#### Infinite Set

A set is infinite if its cardinality is not a natural number.

##### Countably Infinite

An infintie set is countably infinite if its elements can be put into a one-to-one mapping to the natural numbers.

##### Uncountable

An infinite set is uncountable if its elements cannot be put into a one-tp-one mapping to the natural number.

### Cartesian Product

The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted by $` A \times B `$, is the set of all ordered pairs such that the first element of the pair is an element of A and the second element of the pair is an element of B.

$` A \times B = {(a, b): a \in  A and b \in B} `$

### Binary Relation

A binary relation is a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets. For a binary relation R where $` (a, b) \in R `$, the binary relation can be denoted as: $` aRb `$

## Graphs

Graphs are collections of related vertices and edges. Theses collections are known as the vertex set and edge set.

### Directed Graph

A directed graph is a collection of vertices and edges where the vertex set is a finite set and the edge set is a binary relation on the vertex set. Which is to say that, the edges specify an source vertex and target vertex. 

Self-loops, an edge from one vertex to the same vertex, are permissable.
